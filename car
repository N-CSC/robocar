# Step 1: Define the Car class
class Car:
    # Step 2a: Initialize the condition member variable
    condition = "new"
    
    # Step 3a: Define the __init__ method to initialize model, color, and mpg
    def __init__(self, model, color, mpg):
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.mpg = mpg

    # Step 5a: Define a display_car method to describe the car
    def display_car(self):
        return f"This is a {self.color} {self.model} with {self.mpg} MPG."

    # Step 6a: Define drive_car method to update the car's condition
    def drive_car(self):
        self.condition = "used"


# Step 3b: Create an instance of Car with the specified attributes
my_car = Car("DeLorean", "silver", 88)

# Step 4a: Print the member variables of my_car
print(my_car.model)   # Output: DeLorean
print(my_car.color)   # Output: silver
print(my_car.mpg)     # Output: 88

# Step 5b: Display the car's details using display_car method
print(my_car.display_car())

# Step 6b: Print the initial condition of my_car
print("Initial condition:", my_car.condition)  # Output: new

# Step 6c: Drive the car to change its condition
my_car.drive_car()

# Step 6d: Print the condition of my_car after driving it
print("Condition after driving:", my_car.condition)  # Output: used


# Step 7a: Define the ElectricCar class that inherits from Car
class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, model, color, mpg, battery_type):
        # Initialize model, color, and mpg using the parent class's __init__ method
        super().__init__(model, color, mpg)
        # Initialize the battery_type specific to ElectricCar
        self.battery_type = battery_type

    # Step 8a: Override drive_car method for ElectricCar
    def drive_car(self):
        self.condition = "like new"


# Step 7b: Create an instance of ElectricCar
my_car = ElectricCar("Tesla", "red", 120, "molten salt")

# Step 8b: Print the initial condition of my_car
print("Electric car initial condition:", my_car.condition)  # Output: new

# Step 8c: Drive the electric car to change its condition
my_car.drive_car()

# Step 8d: Print the condition of my_car after driving it
print("Electric car condition after driving:", my_car.condition)  # Output: like new
